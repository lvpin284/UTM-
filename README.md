# UTM-Advanced Programming
A Dynamic and Extensible Universal Turing Machine 

In this practical, you will be building on the object-oriented UTM that you created in Practical Sessions 1, 2 and 3. Particularly, you will explore the concepts of interfaces and polymorphism to make your code easy to be reused by other programmers. 

Your task is to integrate your software with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that has already been written to enable TMs to be dynamically loaded and executed in the UTM, as illustrated below.

Submission 

You have to submit two files: practical4-ID.jar and java-ID.zip where ID is your team ID (e.g., if you belong to Team 14: practical4-14.jar and java-14.zip). 

• The JAR file must be executed as a self-contained application according to the requirements specified in the section “Packing Your Work Up”. 

• The ZIP file must contain FOUR artefacts: (1) Source Code Folder, (2) Javadoc Folder, (3) classical-own.desc and (4) Class Diagram. The file classical-own.desc and your class diagram must be in the root directory of the ZIP file.
